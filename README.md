# [Gnome Custom Key Bindings 0.0.3]()

A utility to manage Gnome Control Center custom-keyboard-bindings.

***

## Aims

This project is a redesign/port of [ckb](https://github.com/chrisdenman/ckb), which provides similar
functionality using Bash.

It has sprung into life to:

- Evaluate ChatGPT-4o
- Learn some up-to-date C: tooling, frameworks, IDEs, libs...
- Fill in some gaps in my knowledge with respect to building, testing, packaging and distributing native applications on
  Linux (in particular Ubuntu).
