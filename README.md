# [Gnome Custom Key Bindings 1.0.0]()

A utility to manage Gnome Control Center custom-keyboard-bindings.

***

## Aims

This project is a redesign/port of [ckb](https://github.com/chrisdenman/ckb), which provides similar functionality using
Bash.

It has sprung into life to:

- Evaluate ChatGPT-4o
- Learn some 'state of the art' C tooling.
- Fill in some gaps in my knowledge with respect to: building, testing, packaging and distributing native applications
  on Ubuntu.

***

./install.sh
```
